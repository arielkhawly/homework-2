# homework-2

for this homework, I created a homepage, an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. All of these pages include some form of bootstrap css. 
each page contains a navigation bar, linking the pages to each other 
for the home page, i introduce myself
for the about me page, i formatted it into one row and three columns of information about myself
for the portfolio page, i created seperate boxes that will eventually hold examples of my work
for the contact page, i took css for a form in bootstrap, allowing someone to send me their info
finally, all pages contained a sticky footer, which remains at the bottom of the page no matter what.
